Research AI Assistant
An agentic research assistant that performs autonomous web-based research, drafts detailed answers, and fact-checks them using semantic search and summarization tools â€” powered by LangGraph, LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI.

Features
1. Web Research Agent: Searches the web and gathers snippets using Tavily.

2. Answer Drafting Agent: Drafts coherent answers based on gathered research.

3. Fact Checker Agent: Verifies drafted answers using semantic search + summarization.

4. FAISS Vector Store: Stores research snippets for semantic retrieval.

5. LangGraph Pipeline: Declarative multi-agent pipeline.

6. Streamlit Frontend: Easy-to-use interface for entering queries and viewing results.
